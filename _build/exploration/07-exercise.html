<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Introduction"> </a></h1><p><em>This exercise was adapted from the</em> <a href="https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/blob/master/scRNA-seq/04-scrnaseq_exercise.Rmd"><em>Alex's Lemonade Stand training module</em></a> <em>under a Creative Commons Attribution license</em>.</p>
<p>Our objective for this exercise is to investigate the expression of marker genes across cell types.
Here we consider <em>marker genes</em> to be genes considered by the field to be classic indicators of cell type.</p>
<p>These <em>marker genes</em> are the ones often used for FAC sorting, which is what was done in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29091775">Darmanis et al. <em>Cell Reports.</em> 2017.</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a figure from their paper to give you a very brief overview of their 
FAC sorting methodology.</p>
<p><img src="../figures/glioblastoma_facs.jpg" width=500></p>
<p>For more details on the methods, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29091775">see their manuscript.</a>
But, in short, this study splits cells from a glioblastoma tumor by their cell-type based on their FAC sorting.</p>
<p>The authors identified neoplastic cells using multiple analyses, including a high level of <em>SOX9</em> expression. The neoplastic cells make up the vast majority of the tumor core. So by seeing what marker genes they express, we may get an initial, gene-by-gene idea of how these cells behave.</p>
<p>The end result of this exercise will be a heatmap to compare the mean expression of the marker genes by cell type. We will also visualize the marker gene expression in reduced dimensions by creating a principal components scatterplot that color codes each cell by the expression level of a marker gene.</p>
<p>The <strong>preprocessing exercise</strong> includes filtering and normalizing the raw expression matrix; the <strong>analysis exercise</strong> starts from a pre-processed expression matrix. You can do either or both of these exercises.</p>

<h2 id="Task:-extract-marker-genes">Task: extract marker genes<a class="anchor-link" href="#Task:-extract-marker-genes"> </a></h2><p>For this exercise, we want to analyze specific genes and their expression among 
the cell types in our dataset. We have already added <em>SOX9</em> and <em>CD45</em> as marker genes to investigate as 
controls, due to their use in the methods for FAC sorting. <em>MOG</em> has been added as a different type of control: a gene that wasn't used for FACS, but is related to myelination, and thus the oligodendrocyte phenotype.</p>
<p>Add other genes you are interested in to the gene list we started for you below. 
You can use  <a href="https://www.genecards.org/.">GeneCard</a> to get information about 
your chosen gene. Then add your chosen gene to this data.frame in the same format we have started 
for you by replacing our <code>&lt;FILL_IN_THE_BLANKS&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Note: Here, you'll need to use Ensembl IDs. There are ways to convert these to other forms of gene IDs in a bulk fashion, but for this exercise, we will only need a few genes and we've already set some up for you.</p>

<p>Depending on the gene you chose, it may not be in our filtered matrix, so you 
may need to try a few. 
You can use an <code>in</code> operator to check if the gene you are looking for is in 
our filtered gene matrix (Remember it has to be an Ensembl gene ID e.g.<code>ENSG...</code>,
and it needs to be in quotes).</p>
<p>Use the phrase below to find out if a gene you are interested in is in the filtered dataset:</p>
<p><code>print('ENSG00000125398' in adata.var.index)</code></p>

make a PCA plot, like we did previously, but color the scatterplot points 
according to one of the marker gene's expression.</p>
<p>Perform PCA on the normalized dataset using <code>sc.tl.pca()</code>.</p>
<p>Use <code>sc.pl.pca_scatter()</code> to make a scatterplot of the PCA results, coloring cells
by the expression of a marker gene, of your choosing.</p>
<p>After you have successfully made this plot, repeat this for 
the other genes in your marker list. 
Make more code chunks as you need them.</p>
