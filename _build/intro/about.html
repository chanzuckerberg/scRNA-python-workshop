<h1 id="Analysis-of-single-cell-RNA-seq-data-(Python)">Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data (Python)<a class="anchor-link" href="#Analysis-of-single-cell-RNA-seq-data-(Python)"> </a></h1><h2 id="Course-goals">Course goals<a class="anchor-link" href="#Course-goals"> </a></h2><p>Today it is possible to obtain genome-wide transcriptome data from single cells using high-throughput sequencing (scRNA-seq). The goal of this one-day workshop is to help scientists from all backgrounds (computational or otherwise) feel empowered to explore their scRNA-seq data. Specifically, we hope students leave with the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand a general workflow for dealing with scRNA-seq data</li>
<li>Anticipate and avoid some of the most common pitfalls in scRNA-seq analysis</li>
<li>Build intuition around the tradeoffs inherent in analytical choices</li>
<li>Feel comfortable and confident working with current Python-based tools for single cell analysis</li>
<li>Have better conversations with their collaborators</li>
<li>Know where to find additional information and assistance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Topics-covered">Topics covered<a class="anchor-link" href="#Topics-covered"> </a></h3><p>We'll cover the basics of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality control</li>
<li>Normalization</li>
<li>Dimensionality reduction</li>
<li>Clustering</li>
<li>Differential expression</li>
<li>Exploratory analysis</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Course-non-goals">Course non-goals<a class="anchor-link" href="#Course-non-goals"> </a></h2><p>We have tried to incorporate current best practices and build intuition around methodological choices throughout this workshop. However, single cell data is complex and the field is evolving rapidly. There are also many aspects of this analysis where the field has not yet reached consensus on best practices. A one-day course simply cannot cover all of the relevant considerations and tools. Here, we have prioritized topics and tools that build foundational intuition, and are available in Python with reasonable runtime. Given the one-day timetable, we opt to start from the expression matrix and do not cover processing raw data. While not a comprehensive guide, we hope this serves as a stepping stone to making single cell analysis approachable.</p>
<h2 id="Prerequisites-&amp;-resources">Prerequisites &amp; resources<a class="anchor-link" href="#Prerequisites-&amp;-resources"> </a></h2><p>The workshop consists of explanatory discussions interspersed with hands-on exercises. <strong>We strongly encourage you to bring a laptop with all required packages installed in order to fully participate.</strong> Please follow the instructions <a href="setup.md">here</a></p>
<p>The course is intended for those who have basic familiarity with Python (e.g., at the level covered in a software carpentry workshop). Basic familiarity with the Jupyter notebooks and the command line is helpful but not required.</p>
