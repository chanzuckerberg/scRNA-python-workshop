Computers enable us to infer properties of the world from these descriptions. Data science is the discipline of drawing conclusions from data using computation. There are three core aspects of effective data analysis: exploration, prediction, and inference. This text develops a consistent approach to all three, introducing statistical ideas and fundamental ideas in computer science concurrently. We focus on a minimal set of core techniques that they apply to a vast range of real-world applications. A foundation in data science requires not...",

However, the degree of uncertainty for many decisions can be reduced sharply by public access to large data sets and the computational tools required to analyze them effectively. Data-driven decision making has already transformed a tremendous breadth of industries, including finance, advertising, manufacturing, and real estate. At the same time, a wide range of academic disciplines are evolving rapidly to incorporate large-scale data analysis into their theory and practice. Studying data science enables individuals to bring these techniques to bear on their work, their scientific...",

Inference involves quantifying our degree of certainty: will those patterns we found also appear in new observations? How accurate are our predictions? Our primary tools for exploration are visualizations and descriptive statistics, for prediction are machine learning and optimization, and for inference are statistical tests and models.

To get your mind into the right timeframe, try to imagine London in the 1850’s. It was the world’s wealthiest city but many of its people were desperately poor. Charles Dickens, then at the height of his fame, was writing about their plight. Disease was rife in the poorer parts of the city, and cholera was among the most feared. It was not yet known that germs cause disease;...",

For some time, he had been gathering data on cholera deaths in an area of London that was served by two water companies. The Lambeth water company drew its water upriver from where sewage was discharged into the River Thames. Its water was relatively clean. But the Southwark and Vauxhall (S&amp;V) company drew its water below the sewage discharge, and thus its supply was contaminated. The map below shows the areas served by the two companies.

A crucial element in Snow’s analysis was that the people in the two groups were comparable to each other, apart from the treatment. In order to establish whether it was the water supply that was causing cholera, Snow had to compare two groups that were similar to each other in all but one aspect–their water supply. Only then would he be able to ascribe the differences...",

Randomization keeps the two groups similar apart from the treatment. If you are able to randomize individuals into the treatment and control groups, you are running a randomized controlled experiment, also known as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Sometimes, people’s responses in an experiment are influenced by their knowing which group they are in. So you might want to run a blind experiment in which individuals do...",

In this text, we will use the Python programming language. Learning the grammar rules is essential, and the same rules used in the most basic programs are also central to more sophisticated programs. Programs are made up of expressions, which describe to the computer how to combine pieces of data. For example, a multiplication expression consists of a * symbol between two numerical expressions. Expressions, such as 3 * 4, are...",
